On the viwe course button, you can directly to individual course and thet details. You can find the enroll now button, you can click on this button. No money needed. Thanks.

**Used:**

In this site making by react js. React js is powerfull javascript librery for single page application. For design purpose, I used the react-css fremwork as react-bootstrap. Then I used some raw css to customized design some component.

**Working:**

This site are making on the basis of react router. React router helps render specific component on the specific area without reload the page. I used the hook of react-router-dom like as useParams, useHistory. To change the route instantly and show the specific item, I use the useParams hooks and show details the specific item. This is very simple site. I hope you enjoy it.
